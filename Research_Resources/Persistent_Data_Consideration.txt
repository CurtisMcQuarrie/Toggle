Is it necessary to have scene changes in the game?

What would the scenes be?
	> Menu Scene
	> Game Scene
	
Common panels between scenes
	> Settings
	> Profile
	
Data that needs to be communicated between scenes
	> aesthetic
	> difficulty
	> playerProfile
	
Game Scene would start when difficulty is chosen.
