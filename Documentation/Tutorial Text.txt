There are two main panels you can see when playing the game: the gameboard and the utility panel.
The Gameboard:

The gameboard is where you will play the game.
It holds the Hints and the Tiles.
Tiles:
[Image2] [Image3]
Tiles can be turned On/Off by clicking on them.
Hints:
There are Hints for the rows and columns.
The row hints appear on the left side of the Gameboard.

The column hints appear on the right side of the Gameboard.

Hints are what you use to solve the Gameboard.
Take this Hint for example.
[image6]
This Hint is a row Hint and it tells you several things.
1. There must be 2 Tiles are turned On consecutively (side-by-side). 
2. There is at least 1 Tile afterwards that must be turned Off after the first 2 On Tiles.
3. There is another Tile that must be turned On after the off Tile(s).
Here is what the solution would look like.

The column Hints work the same way, except the solution would be vertical instead of horizontal.
How To Win:
You must use the Hints to determine which Tiles should be turned On/Off.
The Utility Panel:

The utility panel is where you can manipulate the Gameboard or go to other parts of the game.
It consists of several components.
1. A Stopwatch that is just there to tell you how long you have playing the current board.
2. A Clear button that lets you turn all the Tiles in the Gameboard Off.
3. A Reroll button that generates a new Gameboard and therefore new Hints.
4. A Change Difficulty button that takes you to the Difficulty select menu.
5. A Quit button that takes you back to the main menu.
