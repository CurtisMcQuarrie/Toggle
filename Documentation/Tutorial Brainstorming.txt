# Tutorial
## Implementation
### Instantiation Idea 01
Instantiate the gameboard with already made gameboard hints.
### Instantiation Idea 02
Instantiate the gameboard in the default way.
### Guide Idea 01
Mask certain areas of the gameboard.
- Use a panel that is darkened and blocks raycasts.
- Use the mask to have transparent areas where the raycasts are not blocked.
### Guide Idea 02
Use text fields that will describe how the user proceeds through the tutorial.
- When the user clicks on the screen or on a certain area, it will go to the next text.
### Guide Idea 03
The mask can have two purposes:

1. Prevent the user from clicking on something they shouldn't.
2. Act as a button that will call the next tutorial display.

### Gameboard Idea 01
Add an `isTutorial` bool to the `GameboardController`.
This way, the Tutorial Panel can be turned on/off when appropriate.
### Gameboard Idea 02
Add a constructor to the Gameboard that will create a gameboard with pre-determined Hints.
### Tutorial Script Idea 01
Create a `TutorialGUI` class that controls the gui during the tutorial.
Add a check if `isTutorial` is on in the `GameboardController`.
Add an instance of the `TutorialGUI` in the `GameboardController`.
### Stopping Tutorial Idea 01
Stop the tutorial when either:
- The player wins the game.
- The player quits the game.

i.e. Whenever the Gameboard_Canvas is set inactive.
### Tutorial Script Idea 02
Attach the `TutorialController` script to the tutorial panel.
Have the tutorial panel turn off every time the Gameboard_Canvas is set to inactive.
