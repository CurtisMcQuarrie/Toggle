# Gameboard Logic
## Generating a Solution
- Uses a second collection of Tile instances called solutionList.
- Randomly determines the amount of Tile instances that are turned on.
	- This is done based off of a minimum and maximum integer value.
- Once the number of on Tile instances are determined, this amount of unique tuples are generated.
	- These tuples are a pair of integer values that represent the indices of the Tiles that will be turned on.
	- The solutionList then uses these tuples to turn on it's Tiles.
- After all this is complete, the row and column hints are then generated by reading the solutionList.
## Handling Difficulty
There are a few ways of increasing the difficulty in the game.
1. Increasing the board size.
	- This change is very noticeable and the user will have control over this when they begin their custom games.
	- The idea is that the larger the board size, the harder it will be.
2. Decreases the maximum and minimum number of Tiles that are turned on in the solution.
  - This change is not noticeable to user and they will not have control over this.
	- The idea is that the less Tiles in the on state, the harder it will be.
	- This change will occur over time as the player solves consecutive boards (WIP).
	- It may also increase if the player is doing poorly.
