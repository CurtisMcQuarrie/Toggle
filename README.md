Toggle! Remade is available to play at my [itch.io](https://mcquarriecurtis.itch.io/toggle-remade) page.

## Description
Relax and enjoy the nautical themed ambience and casually solve some gameboards!

## How To Play
The goal of the game is turn tiles on until the rows and columns match the hints. The hints are the numbers on along the border of the gameboard. If you see a "2-2", this will mean that 2 tiles must be turned on side-by-side (consecutively), then at least 1 tile is off, and then finally another 2 consecutive tiles on after. 

## Coming Soon
A tutorial mode will be coming soon to help with the learning process! Some changes (including the win SoundFX) will also be improved.

## Development Comments
This is a remake of the original Toggle! puzzle Game. The source code of the original game was lost and so this game was created from scratch again! Created and developed independently by Curtis McQuarrie. Visit my [itch.io](https://mcquarriecurtis.itch.io/) page to play more of my games!
